# TestAutomationFrameworks
# Demoblaze Automation Framework

Demoblaze Automation Framework is a test automation framework specifically designed for the Demoblaze application. It leverages Selenium WebDriver, Java, TestNG, and Maven to provide a solid foundation for writing effective and scalable automation tests.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get a copy of this project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you'll need the following installed on your local development machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- Browser drivers corresponding to the browsers you intend to use for the tests. The current setup uses ChromeDriver.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BigAFJohn/TestAutomationFrameworks.git
Open the project in your preferred IDE.

Import the Maven dependencies by navigating to the pom.xml file and selecting "Maven" > "Reimport".

Ensure that the Java version in the project structure matches your local JDK version.

Running the tests
You can run tests directly from the IDE by right-clicking on the test files and selecting "Run 'Test name'". Alternatively, you can use the TestNG XML file to run a suite of tests.

Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language used for writing the test scripts
Selenium WebDriver: A powerful tool for controlling browsers and performing browser-based automation
TestNG: A testing framework enabling a wide range of testing needs and providing powerful functionalities
Maven: A software project management and comprehension tool
